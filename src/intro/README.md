# Introduction

This is a version of the LFE quick start that has been re-imagined with
the LFE rebar3 plugin in mind.

We will cover the following:

* How to get started quickly with LFE using just `rebar3` and your local
  installation of Erlang
* Creating a new LFE project
* Looking at LFE code in the REPL and in modules
* Provide a little insight on how this works
* Leave you with resources for jumping into LFE in more detail
