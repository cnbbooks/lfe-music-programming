Cover art: Book covers for the 1.x series of LFE vertsions were inspired by the [1968 DEC FOCAL Programming Manual](https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_decpdp8focogrammingManual1968_2885139) with stylised PDP-8 as the dominant cover graphic. For the LFE 2.x series, a new cover was designed along the same lines but using a PDP-11 as the basis.
