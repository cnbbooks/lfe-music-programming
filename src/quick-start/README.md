# Quick Start

To try out `undertone`, you can just clone the project itself:

``` shell
$ git clone git@github.com:lfex/undertone.git
$ cd undertone
```

and then start up the REPL:

``` shell
$ rebar3 repl
```

Note that this does require that you have a modern Erlang installed (version 21 or above) as well as `rebar3`, the famous build and dependency management tool in the BEAM ecosystem.
